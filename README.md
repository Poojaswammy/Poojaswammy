##  About Me

Graduate student in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University, currently exploring opportunities as a Data Analyst. My background includes experience through capstone projects, internships, and academic research focused on data analytics, machine learning, and cloud-based solutions.

I’ve worked on large-scale data projects involving ETL pipeline development, graph-based intelligence systems, and interactive dashboarding using tools like Python, SQL, AWS, Neo4j, and Tableau.

My work reflects cross-functional collaboration, reproducible analytics, and practical implementation of data workflows for decision-making and insight generation.
